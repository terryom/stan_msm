## Bayesian multi-state model in Stan 

Repository is a testing environment for Bayesian hierarchical mortgage default models using Stan programming language. 

## To-Do

- [ ] Write likelihood is markdown. Jackson MSM package on R is a good reference
- [ ] Simulate fake data with simple transition matrix 
- [ ] Estimate model using Stan to recover known parameters 
- [ ] Random effects: investigate hierarchical tools in Stan
- [ ] Write new likelihood with random effects
- [ ] Download FHFA loan-level data and clean data
- [ ] Estimate model on real FHFA data
